# Bootleg Flappy Bird
- I learned about godot by implementing a flappy bird clone following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkDvTdbOIEo
- Assets url: https://github.com/samuelcust/flappy-bird-assets/

# Enhancements:
- Prevent the bird from going out of camera view
- Adjust the height of two consecutive pipes to prevent the scenario that one pipe spawns at bottom and next one spawns at top
- Add sound
